## Tasks

0. [Positive anything is better than negative nothing](./0-positive_or_negative.c) : A C program that will assign a random number to the variable `n` each time it is executed. Complete the source code in order to print whether the number stored in the variable `n` is positive or negative.
	- [Source Code](https://github.com/holbertonschool/0x01.c/blob/master/0-positive_or_negative_c)
	- The variable `n` will store a different value everytime you will run this program.
	- You don't have to understand what `rand`, `srand`, `RAND_MAX` do.
	- The output of the program should be:
		- The number, followed by
			- if the number is greater than 0: `is positive`
			- if the number is 0: `is zero`
			- if the number is less than 0: `is negative`
		- Followed by a new line.
