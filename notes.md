# Grit Notes

- Date: `7th July 2021` Time: `3:17 am`
	- Damn I am being overwhelmed, I want to remember this day.
	- I am thinking twice on not to sign the contract well it's in my prayers.
	- I am two projects behind alot of backlog.
		- They have released `0x08 while I am at 0x06`.
	- Currently on leave to rest, catch up with ALX while I think about the contract.
- Date: `12 July 2021` Time: `6:36 pm`
	- Damn I am still far, but I have managed to finish three projects.
	- Currently behind with `Recursion`, `Static Libraries` and `argc, argv`.
	- I am planning to jump to `argc, argv` before the deadline ends today, then work backwards.
	- Struggling abit here because I am unwell tested positive of Covid when I was on leave.
		- Good news is I have time to catch up before I get back to work.
	- Signed the contract btw.
- Date `14th July 2021` Time: `6:36 am`
	- Still playing catch up, managed to finish `argc, argv` now heading to `malloc, free`, then I do `static, libraries` then finish up with `recursions`.
	- Why am I getting late every single time because I am trying to understand the concepts being taught.
	- I am excited the changed the deadlines to **6am** which means I can try catching up today.
	- I am also excited to learn about `malloc` (*calloc*, *realloc*) and `free` today and how to use `valgrind` to find memory leaks.
- Date `1st August 2021` Time: 9:51 am`
	- So I have finally caught up just finishing one backlog which is recursion.
	- I have also learnt that I need to revisit some topics so I will update on that this month.
	- I am also looking for a dev who is familiar with C really well for one on one sessions but we are still good.
	- Soon to start learning ASM/Assembly programming.
- Date `9th August 2021` Time: `5:05am`
	- Caught up but I have alot to revisit to make sure I have grasped the concept.
	- No pressure though, also haven't finished `recursion` and `more singly linked lists`
	- I love the growth mindset though.

<summary>New Year, new mindset... 😂😂😂</summary>

- So this is a new year and I am hoping that I can try and tackle the C projects once again but this time with a different strategy to master the art.
- Changes:
	+ I will go an extra step to debug some of the programs using GDB to understand how they work underneath.
	+ Will do extra challenges on the side for each topic.
	+ Along the way create vulnerable codes using libraries we are adviced not to use. (**given the opportunity, time will tell**)

<summary>Day 2: 10th Feb 2022</summary>

- [0x01: Variables,if,else,while](./0x01-variables_if_else_while)
- Most of the codes were using for loops, so wrote them once more using while loops.
- I learnt how to view a loop in GDB.

- [0x02: Functions, nested loops](./0x02-functions_nested_loops)
- So the weekend was long, never had internet the whole of friday night and half of the day on saturday.
- Ended up looking at the [0 task: _putchar](0x02-functions_nested_loops/0-putchar.c) under GDB and would say it was a well spent day.
- 14th Feb done some tasks from 1-6 will try and finish the rest today evening.
